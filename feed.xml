<p><em>"Hey Siri, am I a cyborg yet?"</em></p>

<p>You are a system. Well, a biological one, but a system nonetheless. And as with other systems, you are subject to be analysed, or even optimised. Throughout your life, you will gradually develop a greater understanding of this system, through new knowledge and experiences. You will analyse yourself, and better understand your own mind and body. And you will mostly do this in one of two ways:</p>
<p><strong><em>Introspection</em></strong><em> (looking into oneself).Â </em></p>
<p>In philosophy, introspection can be seen as a substantial and <em>secureÂ </em>type of knowledge, it comes from within and therefore has more intrinsic truth. Let's say that at this very moment, <em>y</em><em>ou are feeling inspired.Â </em>How do you know this? By looking into your conscious state of mind - introspectively. It is a type of knowledge that is immediately known, and cannot be measured in an objective manner. You don't need a computer monitoring your pulse and emotions to tell you that you are feeling inspired. <em>You just...know</em> your current mental state and processes (or so philosophers claim, more on that below).Â </p>
<p><em><strong>Observation </strong>(or extrospection, retrospection, interpretation)</em><em>.Â </em></p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: you're giving a TED talk. You're walking across the stage, talking to the audience, and as you do this you're observing yourself, listening to the sound of your voice, looking at your footsteps and noticing your heartbeat. Apologies if that made you nervous...the point here is that this is a type of <em>observational knowledge</em> that is the opposite of introspection - it is known indirectly through our senses.Â </p>
<p>Another example: you've installed an app that records how much time you spend on social media. You open the app after weeks of tracking, and you see: <em>on average, you spend 3 hours every day between Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. </em>What does this tell you about yourself? Addictive habits perhaps, or how easily you get sucked in into your filter bubble. Maybe it reinforces some concerns you already had - "but I didn't know it was <em>this </em>bad!".Â </p>
<h4>The introspection debate</h4>
<p>There is another important distinction between these two types of knowledge, and that is - <strong>introspection may actually not even exist</strong>. Scientifically speaking, that is. This is part of an ongoing debate between philosophy and psychology. Some psychologists argue that there is no such thing as introspection, and instead we derive our own state from <em>interpretive self-attributions, </em>similarly to how we make judgements about other's mental state. This can be unreliable, leading someone to be <em>mistaken about their own perception or character. </em>If introspection does in fact exist as a different type of knowledge, this cannot be evaluated using scientific methods. The very act of trying to scientifically evaluate introspection disturbs the process, in quantum fashion. It's a curious debate that goes back to the late 19th century, then had a 'silent' period where introspection wasn't really talked about, but picked up again in the 1980's, and likely will go on for some time. While philosophers keep exploring more layers of abstraction to the mind, the cognitive scientists keep peeling the layers away, hoping to prove there's nothing there.Â </p>
<p>In other words: we don't fully understand the mind. You can think and make informed judgements of others' behaviour, but not your own - emotional state takes over, and those cognitive biases that you see in others you're often ignorant to in yourself. Plus, your memory is a blurry spaghetti mess. Intuitively resorting to introspective knowledge doesn't necessarily provide useful information.Â </p>

<p>Let's put this in the context of what this post is about. Throughout your life, you'll seek out on a quest for self-knowledge, i.e to find out and interpret information about yourself. This can happen gradually, subconsciously, or it can become a personal goal given your circumstances, or a knowledge gap that you hope to fill, when current knowledge and introspection can't give you an answer. Bit by bit, you strive to develop a more complete picture of your mind and body. This desire is complemented by technology, giving you access to tools and services that were unimaginable a few decades ago. And there's <em>a lot of data</em> that comes with it. Many people don't think about it twice, but others have begun to ask <strong>the question</strong>:</p>
<p><em>"How can I use my personal data to learn more about myself?"</em></p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram <em>(Wolfram Alpha / Mathematica CEO) </em>is one of these people. Back in 2012, Stephen published an essay titled "The Personal Analytics of My Life" (source below), exploring the vast amounts of data he collected about himself from the early 1990's to the early 2010's. Emails, phone calls, footsteps, keystrokes. <i>Yes, keystrokes. </i>Using this data, Stephen asks questions like "how many hours have I spent on the phone each day", or "how has my vocabulary evolved over the years", and analyses it using statistics and visualisation software. He hasn't stopped collecting data since then. In fact, he <em>regrets not starting sooner</em>, and not having more types of data to work with. Being a productivity guru, these insights help Stephen become more productive and do better work, especially since he runs a remote business and is involved in pretty much every aspect of the company. Surprised by the fact that nobody seemed as interested as he was in tracking this data, Stephen hoped that one day this will become the norm:Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day everyone will routinely collect all sorts of data about themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="align-left">Stephen had coined the term "Personal Analytics" - the use of <strong>self-tracking </strong>methods or <strong>self-monitoring </strong>devices to analyse one's own behaviour and physiological responses. He knew how to extract this data from various sources (via scripts, custom software and integrations) and process it using statistical tools (which he built) - technical know-how that many people don't have. In his words:Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>My fundamental thing about personal analytics is, I donâ€™t put any effort into collecting the data. I put effort into getting <em>systems</em> built to do it, and then I make sure the systems keep running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building this kind of personal data infrastructure is not an easy task, and certainly not within reach of most people. But it is getting easier. For starters, a lot of this data is already collected for you - thanks to big tech corporations, love them or hate them. And the <em>systems </em>that Stephen was talking about - many are already in place. From your location history on Google to your sleep activity on Fitbit, it's all there. Today, the privilege of self-tracking is no longer reserved for the tech savvy data hoarders. As we go into the 2020's, we realise the vast amount of data that we've produced over the years, <em>especially the digital natives</em> - those who were born after 1980 and grew up immersed in gadgets. We've been scattering digital footprints across the devices we use, and generated tonnes of data, knowingly or not. Facebook has been around long enough that some people now have <em>14 years of data </em>on the platform. Others may have <em>30 years of emails</em>. This realisation may hit some people and lead them to ask that very question - <em>"what can I do with all this data?".Â </em></p>
<p>While you may not have direct control over how your data is being used, you can take an active interest in it, and assert ownership by exporting it, integrating it with other tools, doing statistical analysis and generally making sense of it in a way that matters to you. Instead of letting yourself be profiled and labelled by algorithms, you can take matters into your own hands and reverse the roles - instead of blindly feeding your data to companies, you leverage their infrastructure, and consume the data yourself to your own benefit.Â </p>
<p>The particular motivation for self-tracking really depends on the person and their circumstances, but generally it's a matter of reflecting and acting upon one's life, in an effort to live healthier, better, and longer. <strong>Fitter, happier, more productive. </strong>For instance, someone in their 20's might be looking for ways to minimise burnout and stress. Older folks may be concerned with their diet or cholesterol levels. Others may want to improve their sleep. Or keep track of every time they sneeze. Whatever the reason, people are digging into their digital data doubles and tracking data that has never been quantified before. You name it - it's probably being tracked by someone, somewhere.Â </p>
<h2>It all started with the weight scale</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/f6/b4/a2/f6b4a2c4ce4fb514c8d0fbbf92482d1e--vintage-scales-kitchen-scales.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="An American penny scale" width="146" height="564">
<figcaption >An american penny scale</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="align-left">Naturally, the concept of self-tracking is not new, and goes back to the late 19th century, when 'penny scales' would allow people to record their own weight for the first time without visiting the doctor's office. Before scales made their way into people home's, they were out in the public - in grocery stores, pharmacies and banks. Reminding everyone to stay healthy, these grandfather-clock-looking devices became the first vending machine in the U.S that provided a service, not a product. Slot a penny in, get your weight and a satisfying bell sound. It was a huge commercial success - between the 1930s and 40s penny scales brought in over 1 billion pennies ($10 million annually). The messaging surrounding the scales was clear: those who weigh themselves - know themselves well, and those who know themselves well - live well.Â </p>
<p>By the time the first domestic scales appeared, a person's weight became an important form of self-knowledge, and once a standard table of height and weight was established, people not only knew their weight, but also what they 'should' weigh ideally. With this industry standard the public had the ability to manage their weight and optimise towards a target. This attached a level of self-worth to a number that we still see deeply reflected in our society today. As one participant of a study confessed:Â </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I donâ€™t feel any way until I know the number on the scale. The numbers tell me how to feel.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quantified Self</h2>
<p>A community that fully embraces <em>"self-knowledge through numbers"</em> is the Quantified Self (QS) movement, which has now grown to 70,000 members around the world since it's foundation in 2007. Originally starting in Silicon Valley, it now encompasses a growing community forum, worldwide meetups and conferences, and even a QS institute. You can find out more about QS <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The community members learn from each other, share tools and frameworks, and constantly strive to get the most out of their data. The tech savvy ones may even build their own personal data infrastructure, similar to Stephen Wolfram, by writing scripts to fetch data from their software and hardware. Others may simply write down their moods on a piece of paper, hoping it will be useful some day.Â </p>

<figcaption>Imagine a fancy dashboard on that laptop screen. And a notification that says 'Constitution + 1'</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While compelling, the Quantified Self movement also begs the question - <em>why</em>? Kevin Kelly, one of the founders of the Quantified Self movement, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The real goal was always personalisation - to have an experiment of n=1. <strong>â€¦</strong>Â  Most medical research is performed at a very large scale where you have thousands of thousands of participants, otherwise it's not really considered valid. But in fact - none of us really want a treatment, therapy or regime that works for everybody - we want something that works for <em>us</em>. So instead of having an <em>n</em> of thousands, we're just going to experiment on ourselves (hence n=1). And if it works for us - then that's<em> all we need.</em>Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an interesting perspective pointing towards our increasingly individualistic society. Although Quantified Self is still far from the data-driven personal utopia, it hints at a society that's more self-aware than ever before. One where technology gives us a more complete picture of ourselves, and where our behaviour is partially rooted in the insights we get from our own data.Â </p>
<p>Of course, it would be delusional to assume that technology will give us all the answers. <em><strong>A</strong></em> <em><strong>truly quantified selfÂ is unthinkableÂ </strong></em>by current standards, since there's so much of what makes us human that can't be quantified, or even rationally explained. This makes me wonder about the implications of the QS movement. Those that get spiralled down the rabbit hole of self-tracking for no apparent reason other than "this data might be useful someday" gives us a glimpse of the possible future, and raises another question: are we moving towards a new tech mania where mankind obsesses over a permanent search of its "true self" through technology-driven introspection? Constantly craving an incremental dose of self-awareness. <em>A new kind of 'filter bubble'.Â </em></p>
<hr>
<p class="align-left"><span style="color: #95a5a6;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Check yo self before you know thy self".</span> - a totally serious proposal for the new QS motto.</em></span></p>

<h3>Upcoming post - Part 2: ExobrainsÂ </h3>
<p>Originally this post was going to include a section about exobrains, somewhat related to self-tracking. However I feel it deserves it's own separate post, so that will be the topic of the next one, out on Monday 2nd November.Â </p>
